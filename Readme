LZW encoder/decoder

The encoder takes a text file as input, encodes it and puts it in another output file. 
The decoder takes the encoded file and decodes it to the original file.
I should have an additional file to check if there's any different between the original file and the decoded one.


%%%%%%%%%%
Done
%%%%%%%%%%
	1.0: Previous code I wrote earlier (Early Febuary 2018). 
		 Seems to work, but not optimized. Uses vectors to store the dictionary and relies on a recursive function to build the dictionary.


%%%%%%%%%%
TODO: 	
%%%%%%%%%%
	1.1: Print the output of the encoder to a file. 
	1.2: Print the output of the decoder to a file.
	1.3: Script for checking the difference between the decoded file and the original.

	2.0 Use hash table (sets or maps) to store the dictionary, hopefully allowing for faster decoding/encoding.
		Use a non-recursive function to build the dictionary.
