LZW encoder/decoder

The encoder takes a text file as input, encodes it and puts it in another output file. 
The decoder takes the encoded file and decodes it to the original file.
TextCheck takes two input files (through the command line), and checks that they have the same number of characters, and that those characters are the same.  


%%%%%%%%%%
Done
%%%%%%%%%%
	1.0: Previous code I wrote earlier (Early Febuary 2018). 
		 Seems to work, but not optimized. Uses vectors to store the dictionary and relies on a recursive function to build the dictionary.
	1.1: Script for checking the difference between two files (e.g. the decoded file and the original - to make sure everything works).
	1.2: Print the output of the encoder to a file. 


%%%%%%%%%%
TODO: 	
%%%%%%%%%%
	1.3: Print the output of the decoder to a file.

	2.0 Use hash table (sets or maps) to store the dictionary, hopefully allowing for faster decoding/encoding.
		Use a non-recursive function to build the dictionary.
